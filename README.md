# Weols User Management Addon
WUMA is an addon that provides server administrators control over what their users can spawn. It enables them to restrict what a usergroup or individual player can spawn, or how many they can spawn. It also provides loadouts for a usergroups or individual player.

## Restrictions

Administrators may restrict any entity, weapon, vehicle, npc, tool, effect, ragdoll, prop model, or entity usage from a usergroup or an individual player. They can also add an anti-restriction which negate any normal restriction in place, this function is meant to add exceptions for players in a usergroup, or to negate an inherited restriction. Restrictions can also be added with a scope to restrict items for a certain period of time or on a specific map.

## Limits

Administrators may limit any entity, weapon, vehicle, npc, effect, ragdoll, or prop model from a usergroup or an individual player. Items may be limited to any value, even infinity, which means it won't have any limit at all. Limits can also be grouped into advanded limits, which allows administrators to set a group of items to the same limit. This limit can be inclusive or exclusive, meaning that all the items can have the same static limit, or all the items may count towards the same limit. Limits can also be added with a scope to restrict items for a certain period of time or on a specific map.

## Loadouts

Administrators may edit any usergroup's or player's loadout. They can add and remove weapons, and set the weapons primary and secondary ammo. They can also assign a weapons as a primary weapon, meaning the players will spawn holding that weapon. Weapons in the loadout can also be added with a scope to add weapons to loadouts for a specific period of time or on a specific map.

WUMA also features a loadout selector that players can access that will allow them to edit their own loadout. They cannot add weapons that are restricted from them.

## Installation

## Compatibility

WUMA implements CAMI which means it is compatible with any admin mod that also implements it. WUMA may conflict with any addons that change any of Garry's Mod standard libraries or certain sandbox functions.
