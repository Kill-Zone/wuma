# Weols User Management Addon
WUMA is a server administrator tool for [Garry's Mod](http://www.garrysmod.com/). It enables server administrators to manage restrictions, limits, and loadouts for usergroups and individual players. It is the successor to [URM](https://github.com/Weol/URM), adding many new features.

This addon requires that the server is running the sandbox gamemode or any derivatives of sandbox (Assuming that the derivative does not change certain gamemode functions).

##Installation
Clone or download into _addons_ folder.
